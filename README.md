Context
-------

Images are so easy to create and share that sometimes they supplant mediums more suitable for the content they contain. You have likely seen images that contain only a block of text, and maybe thought to yourself, "that's dumb, why not just post the text instead?"

Instead of trying to convince people to use something other than an image to share rich content, this project aims to embed the rich content source in its presentation.

Basically a PDF, but it's also just an image.
